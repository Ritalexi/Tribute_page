                 On a very beautiful Wednesday  evening 19 years ago on the <em>16th of May 2001</em>, a baby girl was born<em> OKOLI OGOCHUKWU RITA ALEXIA </em>to the family of Mr & Mrs S.N.OKOLI. 
            She beacame the third child of this small nigerian family but luckily not the last. 
            She was named OGOCHUKWU which means <em>"GOD'S FAVOUR" </em> cause her mother gave birth to her naturally even due to complications.
            She was blessed with two more siblings after her and two siblings before her " Wow...... she was the middle child......".<br>
            Her siblings are:
            <Ol>
                <li>OKOLI GINIKACHUKWU VANESSA MARIE-BAKITHA</li>
                <li>OKOLI CHIDERA ANTHONY PETER</li>

                But life has its way of doing things, sha sha OGO is still trying to dicover herself but<em> Mafo </em>all will be well in the end <em>las las</em>. 
                So, OGO attended both nursery and primary school at <em>DOMINICAN NURSERY AND PRIMARY SCHOOL MAFOLUKU OSHODI LAGOS</em> well she barely remembers the time spent
                 there but she did have a good nand bad time <em>sha sha.</em>
            </p>
<p>
                 Fast-Forward to when she was admitted to <em>QUEEN'S COLLEGE YABA LAGOS</em> she never really said much about her early years at <em>Q.C</em> . 
                But just know that OGO struggled abit with her self-esteem at a point tho it felt like it all got crumbled but sha sha OGO picked herself dusted her shoulders and got back-up <em>MAFO MAFO MAFO MAFO .</em>
            Then fastforward to when she entered senior school wow that was strange she got into <em>SS1 2 3 T.....CHEII</em> P.S- she was always a <em>T-GIRL.</em>
            OGO just started to understand life properly sha she got through and graduated in one piece and peacefully.
